Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), the first Democrat in the DOGE caucus, sees room for bipartisan action: \u201cMore Dems will join... to fight for rational solutions and block irrational proposals.\u201d\n\nKey ideas floated by Democrats include shrinking Homeland Security, cutting fossil fuel subsidies, consolidating agencies, modernizing IT systems, and relocating federal offices out of D.C. Notable supporters include Reps. Ro Khanna, Greg Landsman, and Ritchie Torres, who suggest initiatives like streamlining permits and simplifying forms for taxes and financial aid.\n\nHowever, some Democrats fear potential entitlement cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Moskowitz dismissed these concerns, emphasizing DOGE\u2019s focus on efficiency, not slashing critical programs.\n\nDOGE co-chair Vivek echoed this, refuting claims of entitlement cuts but advocating for workforce reductions\u2014a stance that divides Democrats, particularly those representing federal employees.\n\nSources: Axios",

        "Text": "Here's Elon Musk in 2013, explaining SpaceX's plan to build a commercial spaceport in Texas, which would later become Starbase.\n\n\u201cCape Canaveral is good for eastward launches. Vandenberg for southerly launches. And we figure we need a third launch site that's a commercial launch site.\u00a0\n\nBecause Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg are Air Force bases which is cool, and obviously, there's an important need for Air Force space launch bases, as there is for Air Force airports.\u00a0\n\nBut there's also a need for commercial airports. Just like you wouldn't expect commercial airliners to land at an Air Force base at a normal course of events, it makes sense to have a commercial spaceport.\u00a0\n\nWe need to be able to launch eastward. And we want to be close to the Equator. That basically means the potential states are Virginia through Texas, going south, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\u00a0\n\nWe need to stay on US territory, because rocket technology is considered an advanced weapons technology, so it's very difficult to export that to other countries. So, those are our options.\u00a0\n\nRight now, Texas is arguably the leading candidate.\n\n\u00a0But we need certain legislation passed that's supportive of space launch. I don't think it's particularly controversial, but one of the things we need is we need is to be able to close the beach when we're doing a launch.\u00a0\n\nAnd Texas has the Open Beaches Act. We can't launch if there's someone right next to the rocket on the beach.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, I don't think it's a particularly controversial thing. It's pretty straightforward.\u00a0\nThen, we need a little bit of protection for the-1-in-10,000-person case who complains about the thing. We had this dude who filed a lawsuit against us for our rocket development site in Central Texas, near Waco. He's not even in the same county. He's in a neighboring county. And he also thinks the CIA is listening to his brainwaves. So, we need just a little bit of protection for people like that, so we're not spending a ton of time in court.\u00a0\n\nThat's basically what we're asking for. It's nothing major, and I think it's likely to move forward.\u00a0\n\nIf things go well, there'd be a decision this year, and then we'd start construction next year. And then, probably, the first launches would take place from there in two to three years.\u201d\n\nSXSW, March 09, 2013",
