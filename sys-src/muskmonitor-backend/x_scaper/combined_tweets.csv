2022-07-11,"Dear diary: Tesla is today similar to where Apple was 2012  Iphone had lots of hype, was mediocre the first iterations, Asian producers were caught up &amp; cheaper. Apple was up 10x from unveiling 2007 many thought it was done. 8x more just making new iterations.  Tesla will do same"
2022-07-11,"Apple just continued producing, kept market share dominance &amp; kept high prices.  Only difference is marketing.  Tesla doesn't even have a PR department. Think about how well their sales will be if (when) they do get one.   Tesla will overtake Apple as the world's largest stock."
2022-07-11,"In todays dollar value terms, not only through fiat dilution.  Tesla will sell each vehicle they produce. Why? Because they are battery constrained.  If model 3 &amp; Y market get temporarily saturated, they'll just put the batteries into the cybertruck &amp; Tesla Semi."
2022-07-11,The reason they wait with the Semi is because all the batteries they can get are put into 3 &amp; Y. While Tesla wait for more batteries they'll keep improving the Semi truck. It's already driving around for continuous improvement tests.
2022-07-11,"It's currently an interesting investment case (not advice)  Tesla PE 90 @ 760B Apple PE 23 @2300B  = needs 3x earnings to get to Apple PE and another 3x = 9x from today to get to Apple Mcap &amp; PE.  Tesla sold ~1m cars last year, making ~1,2m cars now.  2 new factories to scale up"
2022-07-11,"Tesla is aiming for 20m cars/year end of this decade.  With Elon time we'll recalculate not reaching that ambitious target &amp; say 14m cars. Still we have the same kind of journey as Apple had from 2012 until today.  Apple went up by 9x, Tesla will likely be heading a similar path."

2022-05-17,Seems like Twitter should welcome external validation if their claims are true
2022-05-17,Interesting
2022-05-17,Exactly
2022-05-17,"This transcription isn‚Äôt precise, but gets the gist of it"
2022-05-17,The audience laughter says it all
2022-05-17,Hello  anyone home?
2022-05-17,Is this legit?
2022-05-17,Tesla AI Day  on Aug 19. So many cool updates!
2022-05-17,"Twitter claims that &gt;95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?"
2022-05-17,"Yes, the purpose of AI Day is to convince great AI/software/chip talent to join Tesla"
2022-05-16,I wonder who funds them
2022-05-16,I hope it‚Äôs a good product!
2022-05-16,"I don‚Äôt have much choice. Provided they don‚Äôt explicitly say that I endorse something, there is no legal recourse."
2022-05-16,It was an honor to meet at Starbase and discuss exciting future projects!
2022-05-16,Billy is the best
2022-05-16,Have you tried just calling them?
2022-05-16,So how do advertisers know what they‚Äôre getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.
2022-05-16,!
2022-05-16,Just a scratch really
2022-05-15,"There is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users, which is the metric that matters to advertisers.Very odd that the most popular tweets of all time were only liked by ~2% of daily active users."
2022-05-15,Yes
2022-05-15,The Golden State is cooking its golden geese
2022-05-15,"Sooo tasty at first, but then no more golden eggs ‚Ä¶"

2022-05-15,Iconiclaconic!platonic
2022-05-15,Shame on  for shoddy reporting!
2022-05-15,Exactly. I have yet to see *any* analysis that has fake/spam/duplicates at &lt;5%.
2022-05-15,That‚Äôs a deep cut (sigh)
2022-05-15,"With usernames like that, the bots aren‚Äôt even trying hard!"
2022-05-15,I‚Äôm a bot &amp; so‚Äôs my wife
2022-05-15,"Yes, that would have a big impact!"
2022-05-15,Good move by
2022-05-15,"No, I interact with interesting comments that I see too, even if made by people I don‚Äôt follow"
2022-05-15,"Tragically, it wasn‚Äôt even oil from a snake!"
2022-05-15,"Wow, you must be Sherlock f* Holmes.I‚Äôm joking."
2022-05-15,"Tried TikTok, but it‚Äôs not winding my ‚è∞"
2022-05-15,Not to mention potential bugs in the code. Open source is the way to go to solve both trust and efficacy.
2022-05-15,"I‚Äôm not suggesting malice in the algorithm, but rather that it‚Äôs trying to guess what you might want to read and, in doing so, inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening"
2022-05-14,"The axiomatic error was that housing prices only go up. I don‚Äôt support predatory lending, but many of those lenders were severely wounded or didn‚Äôt survive. They dug their own graves ‚Äì a lesson we should all take to heart, including me."
2022-05-14,"To find out, my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of  I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover ‚Ä¶"
2022-05-14,Pick any account with a lot of followers
2022-05-14,"Ignore first 1000 followers, then pick every 10th. I‚Äôm open to better ideas."
2022-05-14,"If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage, we can probably crowdsource a good answer"
2022-05-14,Interesting
2022-05-14,"Any sensible random sampling process is fine. If many people independently get similar results for % of fake/spam/duplicate accounts, that will be telling.I picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate &lt;5% fake/spam/duplicate."
2022-05-14,I relied upon the accuracy of Twitter‚Äôs public filings
2022-05-14,Whoever thought owning the libs would be cheap never tried to acquire a social media company!
2022-05-14,The bots are angry at being counted 
2022-05-14,Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100!This actually happened.
2022-05-14,The Lawyers Who Ate California
2022-05-14,Just another day in Elden Ring!
2022-05-14,"At least, that‚Äôs what the lib hivemind thinks haha"
2022-05-14,(This message brought to you by the Illuminaughty)
2022-05-14,Very important to fix your Twitter feed:1. Tap home button.2. Tap stars on upper right of screen.3. Select ‚ÄúLatest tweets‚Äù.You are being manipulated by the algorithm in ways you don‚Äôt realize.Easy to switch back &amp; forth to see the difference.
2022-05-14,"Team is working the weekend to get 10.12 in limited release tomorrow. Then we evaluate, do a point update, and broaden the release. 10.12.2 is probably where we can expand to a safety score of 95+."
2022-05-13,The last straw was the last straw!
2022-05-13,Exactly
2022-05-13,"If Twitter can tell the difference between real and fake users, why does it allow these in our comments?"
2022-05-13,Updated Starlink availability by region
2022-05-13,The drinking bleach hoax was a hoax
2022-05-13,Stop the war on straws!
2022-05-13,But I do think that twitter should authenticate all real users and prioritize those replies above unauthenticated users
2022-05-13,And tastes like cardboard!
2022-05-13,How did it even start?
2022-05-13,Seriously?
2022-05-13,This is messed up
2022-05-13,"It still needs more work imo, but we can probably widen the beta a little next month"
2022-05-13,The straw war is emblematic of larger social issues
2022-05-13,Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users
2022-05-13,Still committed to acquisition
2022-05-12,Overzealous DMCA is a plague on humanity
2022-05-12,Chronological tweets seem much better than what ‚Äúthe algorithm‚Äù suggests
2022-05-12,Tap on the stars in upper right of screen to revert to chronological
2022-05-12,Yeah
2022-05-12,Great thread
2022-05-12,The whole notion of being ‚Äúleft wing‚Äù or ‚Äúright wing‚Äù is silly. Almost no one initially agrees with the semi-random collection of policies associated with each wing.They only support those policies *after* they join the left or right mind tribe.
2022-05-12,Current copyright law in general goes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator
2022-05-12,"Biden‚Äôs mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama"

2022-05-12,"Didn‚Äôt occur to founders of USA that people would live so long, so they put in age minimums (for wisdom), but not age maximums (for ‚Ä¶ )"
2022-05-11,Literally true. Even 100x is possible.
2022-05-11,"Without billions of miles of training data, solving self-driving is impossible"
2022-05-11,Release notes on this version will be long
2022-05-11,Probably this weekend. Lot of code updates means much is discovered during testing.
2022-05-11,Exactly
2022-05-11,"Starlink has resisted Russian cyberwar jamming &amp; hacking attempts so far, but they‚Äôre ramping up their efforts"
2022-05-10,The Tesla China team is amazing
2022-05-10,Important to listen to my full explanation
2022-05-10,Haha 
2022-05-09,Great meeting! We are very much on the same page.

2022-05-09,Twitter obv has a strong left wing bias
2022-05-09,I‚Äôd like to meet this guy (if he is real). Hard to tell with deepfakes these days.
2022-05-09,Chocolate milk is insanely good. Just had some.

2022-05-09,"Dead Space 2, FEAR 2 and Bioshock are great"
2022-05-09,"Like I said, my preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates. If the citizens want something banned, then pass a law to do so, otherwise it should be allowed."
2022-05-09,And we‚Äôre all descended from a skinny shrew! Meet your grandparents^n:

2022-05-06,I didn‚Äôt ask anyone out or request particular seating
2022-05-06,I‚Äôm a big believer in citizen journalism and following individual journalists over publications!
2022-05-06,"If Twitter acquisition completes, company will be super focused on hardcore software engineering, design, infosec &amp; server hardware"
2022-05-06,So much to be done on layout. Every single pixel matters. Hard problem.
2022-05-06,"This rumor originated from a parody account, but got picked up by real media &amp; twitter trends (sigh)"
2022-05-06,Another Starlink mission completed
2022-05-06,"This is false. I‚Äôve had no communication, directly or indirectly, with Trump, who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social."
2022-05-06,We must be doing something right!
2022-05-06,This will trend to well over 10 times safer
2022-05-06,Copycats!
2022-05-06,"Next release (10.12) is another step towards all NN‚Äôs using surround video &amp; reconciling output to a unified vector space for control code.Improves complex intersections in heavy traffic.Many upgrades to core code, so taking longer to debug issues. Probably Wed/Thurs release."
2022-05-06,!!
2022-05-06,Like thrust on a !
2022-05-06,I strongly believe that all managers in a technical area must be technically excellent. Managers in software must write great software or it‚Äôs like being a cavalry captain who can‚Äôt ride a horse!
2022-05-06,It just keeps happening
2022-05-04,And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not in show biz

2022-05-04,Some revenue is better than none!
2022-05-04,Slashdot has some of the best comments
2022-05-04,Interesting. I wonder if those funding these organizations are fully aware of what the organizations are doing.
2022-05-04,"Passive/index investment is simply an amplifier of active investment. If active investment signal degrades in quality, passive is proportionately impacted.Also, if there are very few actual active investors, their decisions can greatly increase company valuation volatility."
2022-05-04,"If that‚Äôs true, it would make me very happy!"
2022-05-04,I dunno ‚Ä¶ seems kinda fungible
2022-05-03,"They will say anything to shift support away from me. Think of it as information war, not normal dialogue."
2022-05-03,"Starlink is awesome for RV‚Äôs, camping or any activity away from cities"
2022-05-03,"That is why we must clear out bots, spam &amp; scams. Is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts? Right now, you can‚Äôt tell.And algorithms must be open source, with any human intervention clearly identified.Then, trust will be deserved."
2022-05-03,There is so much potential with Twitter to be the most trusted &amp; broadly inclusive forum in the world!
2022-05-03,"Yeah, kids starting with lots of money usually have much less motivation than those who have nothing. When we started our first company (Zip2) in 95, I had over $100k of student debt, a computer I built myself and a few thousand dollars."

2022-05-01,"Exactly, decisions are being made on behalf of actual shareholders that are contrary to their interests! Major problem with index/passive funds."

2022-05-01,Not a bad idea
2022-05-01,"Authentication is important, but so is anonymity for many. A balance must be struck."
2022-05-01,"Exactly. Right before he died, Jack Bogle (of Vanguard fame) said index/passive funds were too great a percentage of the market and he really knew what he was talking about! There should be a shift back towards active investment. Passive has gone too far."
2022-05-01,Munger is correct
2022-05-01,Since I‚Äôve been asked a lot:Buy stock in several companies that make products &amp; services that *you* believe in.Only sell if you think their products &amp; services are trending worse. Don‚Äôt panic when the market does.This will serve you well in the long-term.

2022-04-30,"Wellbutrin is way worse than Adderall imo. It should be taken off the market. Every time that drug has come up in conversation, someone at the table has a suicide or near suicide story."

2022-04-29,The people of Twitter strongly agree that Twitter needs to be fixed
2022-04-29,Update probably goes to wide release next week. This is a big one.

2022-04-28,‚ÄúReal magic is only a sip away.‚Äù(Actual slogan of Coca-Cola!!) 
2022-04-27,Sounds pretty bad ‚Ä¶
2022-04-27,Truth Social is currently beating Twitter &amp; TikTok on the Apple Store
2022-04-27,Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech
2022-04-27,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Pretty weird."
2022-04-27,Should be called Trumpet instead!
2022-04-27,"The Washington Post targets me relentlessly! Their insults could be higher quality, but some are not bad. I gave them 3 stars on Yelp."
2022-04-27,"Almost every media outlet on Earth wrote about me acquiring Twitter, causing a massive influx of new users"

2022-04-27,"For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally"
2022-04-26,The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all
2022-04-26,Can someone please give the NPCs a bigger dialogue tree!?
2022-04-26,Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate
2022-04-26,"By ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù, I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people."

2022-04-24,Certainly physically possible. We‚Äôre working on bridging broken links between brain &amp; body.Neuralinks in motor &amp; sensory cortex bridging past weak/broken links in neck/spine to Neuralinks in spinal cord should theoretically be able to restore full body functionality.
2022-04-24,"If you‚Äôve engineered or manufactured smart watches or phones, please join Neuralink! Your skills are directly applicable."
2022-04-24,!
2022-04-24,"Current generation Neuralinks can help to some degree, but an advanced case of Alzheimers often involves macro degeneration of the brain. However, Neuralinks should theoretically be able restore almost any functionality lost due *localized* brain damage from stroke or injury."
2022-04-24,"In the meantime, semaglutide (aka Ozempic/Rybelsus) appears to be effective in appetite control with minor side effects"
2022-04-24,"It is an electronics/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Neuralink device that is similar in complexity level to smart watches (which are not easy!), plus the surgical robot, which is comparable to state-of-the art CNC machines.No need for AI/ NN/ML quite yet."
2022-04-24,Getting there

2022-04-24,"In the coming years, Boring Co will attempt to build a working Hyperloop. From a known physics standpoint, this is the fastest possible way of getting from one city center to another for distances less than ~2000 miles. Starship is faster for longer journeys."
2022-04-24,Yes
2022-04-24,Strange how these things are bucketed. I think of the whole company as being R&amp;D.

2022-04-23,Good list
2022-04-23,Something like that
2022-04-23,"Yeah, but I didn‚Äôt leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it‚Äôs not exactly top secret."

2022-04-21,"My true moral error was creating Tesla &amp; SpaceX at same time, while avoiding general mgmt chores at Tesla (focusing only on product &amp; engineering). Tried to have my cake &amp; eat it too, which failed."
2022-04-21,Tesla is really a dozen or more startups if you look at all the things created from scratch that aren‚Äôt present in other car companies

2022-04-21,"Please consider working at The Boring Company! Our goal is to solve traffic, which plagues every major city on Earth."
2022-04-21,"Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion‚Äôs Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard. Even name ‚ÄúTesla Motors‚Äù was owned by others!"
2022-04-21,"If filing a shell corp constitutes ‚Äúfounding a company‚Äù, then I‚Äôd be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for  (later renamed PayPal), but that‚Äôs not what founding means."
2022-04-21,"When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all."
2022-04-21,"They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!"
2022-04-21,Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He‚Äôs a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
2022-04-21,"But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla, he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007.We would‚Äôve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal, but we lost no one."
2022-04-21,"I put in all I had, whereas Eberhard, who was worth over $10M at the time, refused to invest a penny to help Tesla. If it was really his baby, he would never have stood by while it starved to death."
2022-04-21,Exactly
2022-04-21,"I should, but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla, SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book."
2022-04-21,"The failures are mine, the successes belong to others"
2022-04-21,Diess deserves a lot of credit for moving VW rapidly towards electrification. They‚Äôre lucky to have him.
2022-04-21,Maybe JB would be up for that too. He deserves a lot of credit (as do many longtime Tesla people).

2022-04-21,Resistance is futile
2022-04-21,"Agreed. I wish JB &amp; I had just moved forward to commercialize the Tzero without adding other partners. In the end, that‚Äôs what happened anyway."
2022-04-21,Ok sure
2022-04-21,"Such a joy to work with amazingly talented people at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co!"

2022-04-18,"Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that‚Äôs ~$3M/year saved right there"
2022-04-17,"Based on feedback received, we will drop mobile connector price to $200 &amp; make it easy to order with car. Note, mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or to use Superchargers.Recommend installing Tesla wall connector well before car arrives."
2022-04-17,Happy Easter!
2022-04-17,Smooth landing video
2022-04-16,"In fairness to the Twitter board, this might be more of a concern about other potential bidders vs just me"
2022-04-16,"Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side, we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit."
2022-04-16, Love Me Tender 
2022-04-16,"Wow, with Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares! Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders."
2022-04-16,"Civilization, as defined by the invention of writing, is only ~5500 years old"
2022-04-16,!
2022-04-16,Indeed
2022-04-16,Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines!
2022-04-15,My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is *way* overdue for long form tweets!
2022-04-15,Thanks for the support!
2022-04-14,"Interesting. Just two questions, if I may. How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly &amp; indirectly?What are the Kingdom‚Äôs views on journalistic freedom of speech?"
2022-04-14,"Absolutely. It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors."
2022-04-14,Good question
2022-04-14,Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
2022-04-14,"Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board"
2022-04-14,I made an offer
2022-04-14,"If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale."
2022-04-14,As I was saying ‚Ä¶

2022-04-14,iu

2022-04-10,Great idea
2022-04-10,Weather is fake. I seen Truman Show!
2022-04-10,"You will get it back, even though you shorted Tesla, you bastard "
2022-04-10,Exactly. It would massively expand the verified pool &amp; make bot armies too expensive to maintain.
2022-04-10,Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?
2022-04-10,"Yes, should be proportionate to affordability &amp; in local currency"
2022-04-10,"Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front &amp; account doesn‚Äôt get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) &amp; suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam"
2022-04-10,Exactly

2022-04-09,Most of these ‚Äútop‚Äù accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying?
2022-04-09,"For example,  hasn‚Äôt posted anything in 3 months"
2022-04-09,And  only posted once this entire year
2022-04-09,Now subtract crypto scam accounts that twitter constantly shows as ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in everyone‚Äôs feed

2022-02-23,"I‚Äôm a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it.For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python."
2022-02-23,Compilers can be way better too. Not enough effort spent there.
2022-02-23,Definitely
2022-02-23,"While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the ‚Äúhard one‚Äù, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can‚Äôt just jam GPUs in the trunk."
